my journey's (hafil)
<br>
Hi, my name is hafil
<br>
In this i have created a simple webpage for roll a dice<br>
hear in have use html,css and js for this mini project .<br>

In my html file i have created button to roll a dice and label inside the button to show the random number,using css i have changed the color and background color and some outher style to make our dice color full and similar to dice.<br>
In js i have created a simple  function.<br>
when a user clicks on the button (dice) the function generate the random number and dislpay iton the label (inside the button) <br>
To generate random number i have used math.randon() a function and set a value of maximum =6 and minmum=1.
